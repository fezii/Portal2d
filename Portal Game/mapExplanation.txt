This is the translated version of the pickled map data. 
It was pickled because I used an open-source map editor to create my tiled map 
(cheating? I didn't know how else to make a tiled map except by manually changing each digit, or by making a map editor myself).
The editor outputs a serialized file (level1_data), and needing a way to translate the data,
I used the pickle module to convert it into a form my program could actually use.

```
pickle_in = open(f'level1_data', 'rb')
world_data = pickle.load(pickle_in)
world = World(world_data)
```
Each tile on the map is represented by a number from the array below

0 corresponds to empty space
1 corresponds to a non-portal-able tile
2 corresponds to a portal-able tile

world data = [
